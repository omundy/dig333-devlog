1\. Follow the [class presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1G4jdcr8KzWpIiIduQyFiQJEG-PFJHpovJb9rWhxhNYw/edit?slide=id.g10e831bd841_0_47#slide=id.g10e831bd841_0_47) to create a functioning circuit on Tinkercad and link to it here.

- This is the link to my TinkerCad file: https://www.tinkercad.com/things/5BKPF1dmEkf/editel?returnTo=%2Fdashboard%2Fdesigns%2Fcircuits&sharecode=NNx_EzdIgppr4zJTY_xKjR2p-cTB3LXU7MTO6eR9X54



2\. Share your maths using Ohm's law to find the resistor value for your Tinkercad circuit.

- Battery voltage = 9V, the voltage drop from the LED = 2V, the LED current rating = 20mA. Therefore the resistance needed to power the resistor is given as R = (9-2)/0.02 = 350 ohms.



3\. 📚 Read Chapter 01 - A People's History of Electronic Music (2-14) and Chapter 02 - Musical Electricity for Electrophobes (15-up to 38) in [Electronic music from scratch](https://www.makershed.com/products/make-electronic-music-pdf) (Pearson). Write a comment on one of Pearson's phrases that speaks to you. (2-3 sentences) 

- I found his introduction to be amusing, especially the commont that said," Humans have a great track record of doing amusing things that their survival isn't contingent on. I also found the breakdown of how both the Moog synthesiser and the Theremin instrument came to be, to be extremely insightful.


4\. Explore Ishkur’s Guide to Electronic Music 2.0 https://music.ishkur.com/ referenced by Pearson. Describe the influence of one genre from this guide on your current musical listening habits. `(2-3 sentences)`

- I thought the breakdown of the timeline for electronic music and how they birthed new subgenres to be incredible. Off the many genres and subgenres shown, I listen to Grime from the UK Garage quite frequently. From listening to the examples, I realized how much the subgenre had evolved.



5\. 🎬 Watch this introduction to [Synthesizing with Moog - Lesson 1: Listening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waN4owHeyaQ) (15:33). Describe one of Robert Moog's contributions to electronic music.

- He came up with the synthesizer which was a essentially a set and most regularly used number of modular oscilators with variable voltage control in a a much smaller system to make them mroe accessible for people to use.



6\. The Moog video references ideas also presented in Pearson's "Speaker as microphone" experiment (p.37) explain what a microphone, a speaker, and the human ear have in common? (2-3 sentences) 

- They are all transducers. They can either transform electric signals into acoustic waves or transform acoustic signals into electric signals.  



7\. 🎬 Explore cinematic scores and other works created by [Wendy Carlos](https://www.google.com/search?q=wendy+carlos+filmography) using a Moog. Paste a link to an online example and describe what you like about the composition, performance, connection to themes in the film, etc. (2-3 sentences) 

- I love the Tron Score by Wendy Carlos (https://youtu.be/TPF7CXUgcus?si=SD88I2nAnaZ4ZvfR). This is because, I like the way she incorporates both the synthesizer and a live orchestra in the recording of the score, and what's even cooler is she recorded it with the London Philharmonic Orchestra.
