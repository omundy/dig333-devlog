## Articles

Tom Igoe [Physicality and Conviviality](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fi4mN-Oicos) (15:17) talks about the origins of the ITP program and the Arduino.
- Summary: The ITP program emerged to give people more control over media and computing.
- Quote:
- Comment: It's great that the Arduino is still open source. I think that is a big reason why it is still successful. I love the idea of using mud to work PowerPoint!
- If high performance technology is accessible to everyone, then how do we ensure such electronics are not being used for harm?

Some evidence that there are possibly ways to get the FTDI to work on M1 Apple Silicon but they were short lived, and I could only program it once before it stopped working.

## Experiments



### [Learn Computing: The Command Line](https://omundy.github.io/learn-computing/slides/command-line.html)

#### Outcomes
- I learned to use my computer with only text commands (no GUI).

Here are some commands I learned

```bash
# write a string
echo Hello World!
# -> Hello World!

# put working directory
pwd
# -> /Users/owenmundy

# test the connection to a server
ping -c 5 davidson.edu
# -> PING davidson.edu (23.185.0.1): 56 data bytes
# -> 64 bytes from 23.185.0.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=59 time=18.155 ms
# -> 64 bytes from 23.185.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=59 time=25.619 ms
# -> ...
# -> --- davidson.edu ping statistics ---
# -> 5 packets transmitted, 5 packets received, 0.0% packet loss
# -> round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 17.387/21.148/26.858/4.182 ms
```

#### Comments & Variations
- Building education tools is always a fun experiment 🤔

#### Questions
- Quiz Question: How can you autocomplete commands once you start typing?
