1\. Create an LED circuit with a ([class presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1G4jdcr8KzWpIiIduQyFiQJEG-PFJHpovJb9rWhxhNYw/edit?slide=id.g1f89d7c4b1c_0_53#slide=id.g1f89d7c4b1c_0_53)). Record the voltage drop from each step and amps used in the circuit: 

- The voltage drop from my 1 kilo ohm resistor and the green LED was 7.61V from the original 9V. The voltage dropped further with the red LED from 7.61V to 5.36V. Finally the voltage dropped 5.36V to 3.52V when connected to a blue LED.



2\. Create a three-LED circuit on Tinkercard and measure Voltage Drop and amps using their multimeters ([class presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1G4jdcr8KzWpIiIduQyFiQJEG-PFJHpovJb9rWhxhNYw/edit?slide=id.g1f89d7c4b1c_0_53#slide=id.g1f89d7c4b1c_0_53)).

3\. 📚 Read Chapter 02 - Musical Electricity for Electrophobes (39-45) in [Electronic music from scratch](https://www.makershed.com/products/make-electronic-music-pdf) (Pearson). Write a comment on one of Pearson's phrases that speaks to you. (2-3 sentences) 

- For this week's chapter, I found Mr. Pearson's introduction of electricity to be quite intriguing and amusing. I like how he likened it to the mechanical world and stating the fact that their only differences are the fact that they operate on a totally different set of rules. I also appreciated the breakdown of electricity in such an understandable way and the provision of illustrations to make it mroe relatable


4\. Follow the Piezomania (39) and Sound through your skull (42) experiments. 


5\. Create a groundbreaking musical instrument using Pearson's advice in the conclusion of the chapter to customize your circuit to play sound in a new way.

- The video documentation of my musical instrument is saved in this google drive folder. ( https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1Ic6HQ47hFD2-g0eAT86duXwh78u2Lel2 )


6\. 📚 Read Chapter 03 - The Hello World Oscillator (46-59) in [Electronic music from scratch](https://www.makershed.com/products/make-electronic-music-pdf) (Pearson). In your own words, why should you be careful with capacitors?

- This is because, capacitors store and discharge charges, like the bucket analogy. If you connect this to an extremely high voltage, storing too much water in the bucket. It could blow up which is extremely dangerous. 



7\. What is the difference between an analog and digital component?
- Analog components are mechanical in nature with a continous value flow, while digital components use set countable values, or that is how I kind of understood it. 


8\. [👉Activity: Analyze square waveforms with an oscilloscope](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1G4jdcr8KzWpIiIduQyFiQJEG-PFJHpovJb9rWhxhNYw/edit?slide=id.g3b8d920f8b7_0_49#slide=id.g3b8d920f8b7_0_49). On the Snap-on Waveform demo board, which pot controls variable voltage (duty cycle) and which controls variable frequency (PWM slides)? What is a common use of each? Post a photo of your testing.

- I looked at the slides but I was wondering if we were supposed to go to VAC 212 on our own or wait till class time.




9\. 🎬 Watch [Synthesizing with Moog - Lesson 2: Dynamics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4FNmoN7Z0) (15:33). Which tells us that every musical sound has three defining characteristics. What are they?

- The volume of the sound: Amplitude 
- The musical note played: Pitch
- The sonic signature of a sound distinguishing a note played on one instrument from the same note played on a different instrument: Timbre

10\. If you were to make a list of your top 10 songs, share a link (e.g. youtube) to one that demonstrates an envelope generator at work, as well as the timecode for that position. Here is an example: 

> The opening synth keyboard melody in Com Truise [Galactic Melt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOhpjcvtyVE&list=PLhpnnpt3tw-TQ102FLVMJabccj51wEeUH) uses a very short attack, making it punchy and alive. The base synth (`1:30`) uses a slower attack, adding to its weight and helping to ground the tempo. —Owen Mundy

- ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPyyovWN6Bw&list=RDSPyyovWN6Bw&start_radio=1 ) This is M83's Raconte Moi-Une Histoire. It starts witha synth kepyboard which pushes the notes in a short and pushy manner, but then it has some feedback bleed at the end, the notes are then harmonized and joined in by a guitar, drums, and vocals. Later in the track, a synth keyboard on sustain is added.
