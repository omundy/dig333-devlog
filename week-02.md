2\. Create a three-LED circuit on Tinkercard and measure Voltage Drop and amps using their multimeters ([class presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1G4jdcr8KzWpIiIduQyFiQJEG-PFJHpovJb9rWhxhNYw/edit?slide=id.g1f89d7c4b1c_0_53#slide=id.g1f89d7c4b1c_0_53)). 

- Link to your (publicly-accessible) https://tinkercad.com file



3\. 📚 Read Chapter 02 - Musical Electricity for Electrophobes (39-45) in [Electronic music from scratch](https://www.makershed.com/products/make-electronic-music-pdf) (Pearson). Write a comment on one of Pearson's phrases that speaks to you. (2-3 sentences) 

- Your response



4\. Follow the Piezomania (39) and Sound through your skull (42) experiments. 



5\. Create a groundbreaking musical instrument using Pearson's advice in the conclusion of the chapter to customize your circuit to play sound in a new way.

- Add video documentation of a performance of your musical instrument.



6\. 📚 Read Chapter 03 - The Hello World Oscillator (46-59) in [Electronic music from scratch](https://www.makershed.com/products/make-electronic-music-pdf) (Pearson). In your own words, why should you be careful with capacitors?

- Your response



7\. What is the difference between an analog and digital component?



8\. [👉Activity: Analyze square waveforms with an oscilloscope](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1G4jdcr8KzWpIiIduQyFiQJEG-PFJHpovJb9rWhxhNYw/edit?slide=id.g3b8d920f8b7_0_49#slide=id.g3b8d920f8b7_0_49). On the Snap-on Waveform demo board, which pot controls variable voltage (duty cycle) and which controls variable frequency (PWM slides)? What is a common use of each? Post a photo of your testing.

- Your response




9\. 🎬 Watch [Synthesizing with Moog - Lesson 2: Dynamics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH4FNmoN7Z0) (15:33). Which tells us that every musical sound has three defining characteristics. What are they?

- The volume of the sound: ______________ 
- The musical note played: ______________
- The sonic signature of a sound distinguishing a note played on one instrument from the same note played on a different instrument: ______________

10\. If you were to make a list of your top 10 songs, share a link (e.g. youtube) to one that demonstrates an envelope generator at work, as well as the timecode for that position. Here is an example: 

> The opening synth keyboard melody in Com Truise [Galactic Melt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOhpjcvtyVE&list=PLhpnnpt3tw-TQ102FLVMJabccj51wEeUH) uses a very short attack, making it punchy and alive. The base synth (`1:30`) uses a slower attack, adding to its weight and helping to ground the tempo. —Owen Mundy
